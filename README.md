**Itinerary**
This webapp allows users to search for exciting cities to visit and plan their trips. 

This is hosted on: https://projectf-371d9.firebaseapp.com/

In order to run functions that depend on the Google Maps API, you must **download the CORS Chrome Extension** found here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en

**Some notes:** 

This is a prototype version of the app as it is not hooked up to a database. All trips will save locally as you use the app, but once you refresh, they will be gone. 

We have also populated this user's account with a few upcoming and completed trips to show how a dashboard may look once you've used the app.
