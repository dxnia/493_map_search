#Itinerary
This webapp allows users to search for exciting cities to visit and plan their trips. 

###Some notes:
**To run locally**, use the command
`firebase serve`
This will allow you to go to [localhost:5000](https://localhost:5000) and run locally

**To deploy**, use the command
`firebase deploy`
This will make the website live, **SO BE CAREFUL**.

**Some notes:** 

This is a prototype version of the app as it is not hooked up to a database. All trips will save locally as you use the app, but once you refresh, they will be gone. 

We have also populated this user's account with a few upcoming and completed trips to show how a dashboard may look once you've used the app.
